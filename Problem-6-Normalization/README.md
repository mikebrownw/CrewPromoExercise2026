# Problem 6: Normalization and Data Modeling

## Given Denormalized CSV Structure

## Requirements
Propose a normalized and cleansed data model with:
- PK/FK constraints
- UNIQUE constraints
- CHECK constraints (qty > 0, price >= 0, etc.)

## Tasks
1. Design normalized schema (3NF)
2. Create tables with appropriate constraints
3. Provide ETL migration from denormalized to normalized
4. Include data validation and cleansing steps

## SQL Dialect
All solutions written in SQL Server/T-SQL (SSMS 17 compatible)
